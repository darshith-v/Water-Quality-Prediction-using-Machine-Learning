# Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict water quality based on certain parameters. The goal is to classify water samples as drinkable or non-drinkable.

## Features

- Predicts water quality as drinkable or non-drinkable
- Uses machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/darshith-v/Water-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning/
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run `jupyter notebook` to open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open `water_quality_prediction.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes features like pH levels, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc. It was sourced from [insert dataset source].

## Algorithms

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Other algorithms were experimented with for comparison.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in predicting water quality.

## Visualization

Matplotlib was used to create visualizations such as confusion matrices to better understand the model's performance.
